# JMC QA

Collection of scripts to download and setup JMC, setup Jemmy, and run tests.

## Requirements

1. mercurial
2. maven
3. openjfx

On Fedora this can be accomplished with: `sudo dnf install java-11-openjdk mercurial maven openjfx`

## Running the scripts

The scripts are written using Python 3, and will need to be executed accordingly. 

- e.g., `python3 1_setup_jmc.py`

The scripts are named to indicate the order they should be executed in.
